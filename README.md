# Analysis-on-Political-Books-network
In this project it is faced the analysis of a network in which the nodes are books regarding US Politics, sold by the online bookseller "Amazon.com". In particular, it is an heterogenous net with three types of books: conservative, liberal and neutral. These alignments were assigned separately by Mark Newman based on a reading of the descriptions and reviews of the books posted on Amazon. Edges represent frequent co-purchasing of books by the same buyers, as indicated by the "customers who bought this book also bought these other books" feature on Amazon.
